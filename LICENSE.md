You're allowed to use this code for inspiration. I do not like people copying everything into their own projects and *releasing them*.
If you decide to copy everything I must ask; why? Just to make yourself look good?

Who bother trying? Just give the bot a nickname and deal with it. Invite it, it's public.

Thanks for noticing this and maybe even reading through the last part. You care.
Thanks.
